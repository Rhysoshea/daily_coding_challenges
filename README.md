#### Algorithm problem sets

1. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers add up to k
2. Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
3. Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.
