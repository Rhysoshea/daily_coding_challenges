#### Algorithm problem sets

1. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers add up to k
2. Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
3. Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.
4. Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in LINEAR TIME AND CONSTANT SPACE. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
5. cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.
6. An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.
7. Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
8. A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value. Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
9. Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
10. Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.
11. Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
12. There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
14. The area of a circle is defined as pi.r^2. Estimate pi to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.
15.  Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.
16. You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this.
17. Given a file directory path, compute the longest path length of the location of a file, or an empty string if no file is present.
